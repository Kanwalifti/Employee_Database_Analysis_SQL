#Employee Database Project:

In this research project, we investigated the employee data of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. The only available records from that era consist of six CSV files.

- Data Modeling
  To effectively manage and analyze the data, we designed appropriate tables to store the information extracted from the CSV files. Using SQL, we imported the CSV data into a relational database, allowing us to perform comprehensive data modeling, engineering, and analysis.

- Data Engineering
  Throughout the project, we conducted data modeling to ensure the data was structured and organized in a meaningful manner. Subsequently, data engineering techniques were applied to efficiently handle and store the data within the SQL database.

- Data Analysis
  Finally, we carried out data analysis, answering specific questions about the employee data to gain valuable insights into the workforce of the corporation during the specified time period. This encompassed exploring patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

Overall, the project involved a comprehensive approach to examine the employee database, incorporating data modeling, engineering, and analysis to extract valuable information from the available records.
